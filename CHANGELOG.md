## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Global Theme Propagation**: All page-level elements (headings, cards, inputs, buttons, badges, table headers, focus rings) now respond to the active theme via CSS custom property overrides in `style.css`. Changing themes in the sidebar instantly updates every page's appearance.

  - 🌅 **Sunset** — Warm stone with orange accents
  - 👑 **Royal** — Deep indigo with purple accents
  - 🌹 **Rose** — Dark navy with rose-pink accents

- **CSS Custom Properties**: All theme colors are injected as CSS custom variables (`--t-*`), enabling any component to reference the active theme tokens.

### Changed

- **App.vue**: Completely rebuilt to use CSS classes driven by custom properties instead of hardcoded Tailwind colors. Sidebar, nav links, section headers, logout button, and footer all respond to theme changes in real-time.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Secure First-Install Setup**: On first launch (when no users exist), the app shows a dedicated setup screen to create a Super Admin account with username, password, and confirmation. No default credentials are ever exposed.

### Changed
